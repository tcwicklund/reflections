When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Backups or if multiple people are contributing to the project/application.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
  stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Requiring changes be manually made rather than having Git stay up-to-date avoids pulling unwanted 
  code.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are clones on GitHub.  Clones are used to synchronize a remote repository locally. Branches are paths inside a repository.
