When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Backups or if multiple people are contributing to the project/application.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
  stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Requiring changes be manually made rather than having Git stay up-to-date avoids pulling unwanted 
  code.
